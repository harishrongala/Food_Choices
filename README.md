Data is raw and uncleaned. Cleaning is in the process and as soon as that is done, additional versions of the data will be posted. Acknowledgements
Thank you to all the students of Mercyhurst University who agreed to participate in this survey.

## Inspiration

How important is nutrition information for today's college kids? Is their taste in food defined by their food preferences when they were children? Are kids of parents who cook more likely to make better food choices than others? Are these kids likely to have a different taste compared to others? There a number of open ended questions included in this dataset such as: What is your favorite comfort food? What is your favorite cuisine? that could work well for natural language processing
